        <p>
          Food names must correctly describe the food. For example, strawberry yoghurt must contain strawberries. If the
          yoghurt contains strawberry flavouring instead of the fruit, then the name would need to be strawberry-flavoured
          yoghurt.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Food Standards Code includes definitions for many foods, which includes what a food is made of. For example, a
          fruit juice cannot contain added water but a fruit drink can have water added.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some food have names that must be used (
          <a data-accordion-item="prescribed-names" className="accordion-btn">
            prescribed names
          </a>
          ). For example, 'fermented processed meat - cooked' or 'infant
          formula'.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name of the food must not include words, statements, claims, pictures or graphics that represent a food in a
          way that is untrue, misleading or dishonest. For example, you cannot show a picture of honey on a yoghurt that does
          not contain honey.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the name of the food does not reflect its true nature, then you must include a description of the true nature on
          the label. For example, Luke's Hot's Sauce (red chilli pepper sauce).

        <p>A characterising ingredient or component of a food is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>mentioned in the name of the food; or</li>
          <li>usually associated with name of the food by a consumer; or</li>

          If an ingredient is usually associated with the food (for example, fruit in Christmas pudding), or is highlighted
          on the label in words, pictures, or graphics, then it is a characterising ingredient. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Strawberries are a characterising ingredient in strawberry yogurt</li>
          <li>Meat is a characterising ingredient in a meat pie</li>
          <li>Honey is a characterising ingredient where a yoghurt label shows a picture of a pot of honey</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The amount of the characterising ingredients in the food must be written on the label as a percentage or, if
          declared in the nutrition information panel, as the average quantity per serving and per unit quantity.

          <b>If the food is non-alcoholic or brewed soft drink:</b>
          <br />
          Non-alcoholic drinks and brewed soft drinks (e.g.: fermented ginger beer or kombucha) must not suggest the product
          is an alcoholic beverage. There is a possible risk that brewed soft drinks may contain alcohol which need extra
          labelling requirements. We recommend you seek professional advice to prepare your food label.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>If the food is tea or coffee:</b>
          <br />
          There are naming rules for coffee and tea. Please read the Food Standards Code to ensure your label is correct.
        </p>
        <p>Coffee and tea include types that are: caffeinated, decaffeinated, instant or soluble.</p>
        <p>
          <b>If your food is spring water or mineral water:</b>
          <br />
          Spring and mineral water means ground water.
