          Directions for use are the instructions for how to prepare the food so
          that it is ready to eat. This includes directions that are required
          for health or safety reasons.

        <p>
          For example: frozen chicken tenders may have the directions for use as
          “This is a raw product. Must be cooked prior to eating. Cook from
          frozen. Please ensure chicken is fully cooked before eating”.

          For example, storage conditions for milk may be “store below 5°C”.
