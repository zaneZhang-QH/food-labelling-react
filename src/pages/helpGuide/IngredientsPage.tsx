          The ingredient list is a statement of ingredients that are used to
          make the food. The ingredient list must be shown on the label for most
          packaged food.
        </p>
        <p>Some packaged foods do not need an ingredient list. For example:</p>

        <p>
          Where from time to time, a food ingredient or additive is replaced
          with another food or additive that serves the same function, both can
          be listed, provided it is clear that a substitute or alternative
          ingredient is being declared.
        </p>
        <p>

          sunflower oil.

      <>
        <p>
          If you mention an ingredient, category of ingredients or a part of the
          food in the name on the label, then it becomes a characterising
          ingredient or component.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an ingredient is usually associated with the food (for example,
          fruit in Christmas pudding), or is emphasised on the label in words,
          pictures, or graphics) then it is a characterising ingredient.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Strawberries are a characterising ingredient in strawberry yogurt
          </li>
          <li>Meat is a characterising ingredient in a meat pie</li>
          <li>
            Honey is a characterising ingredient in a yoghurt with a picture of
            a pot of honey on the label
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The amount of the characterising ingredients in the food must be
          written on the label as a percentage or, if declared in the nutrition
          information panel, as the average quantity per serving and per unit
          quantity. For example, strawberry yoghurt ingredients must state{" "}
          <b>Strawberries (23%).</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          If the amount of the characterising ingredient is less than 5%, then
          the proportion must be given to the nearest 0.5 decimal place, e.g.
          Banana (4.5%)
        </p>
        <p>The percentage information is not required for the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>prepared filled rolls, sandwiches, bagels or similar products</li>
          <li>
            food sold at a fundraising event, for example, cake stalls and
            school fetes
          </li>
          <li>food sold in small packages</li>
          <li>cured and/or dried meat flesh in whole cuts or pieces</li>
          <li>foods with one ingredient</li>
          <li>
            ingredient or category of ingredients that is used in small
            quantities for the purpose of flavouring, for example, herb and
            garlic bread

          A compound ingredient is an ingredient that contains two or more
          ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tomato paste is an ingredient in a pre-made pizza base. The tomato
            paste is a <b>compound ingredient</b> as it is made up of the
            following ingredients: tomato, canola oil, olive oil, sugar, salt,
            citric acid (330), basil, oregano.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dark chocolate chips are used as an ingredient in chocolate chip
            muffins. The dark chocolate chips are a <b>compound ingredient</b>{" "}
            as they are made up of the following ingredients: sugar, cocoa mass,
            cocoa butter, natural vanilla flavour.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If a food contains compound ingredients which contributes 5% or more
          to the final food, then all the foods and additives in that compound
          ingredient must be declared in the ingredient list.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a food contains compound ingredients which contribute less than 5%
          to the final food, then only allergens and food additives must be
          listed.

        <p>
          The ingoing weight of water or an ingredient which is completely
          removed during processing must be calculated according to Standard
          1.2.4-5 of the Food Standards Code and added to the statement of
          ingredients in the order of descending weight.

        <p>
          <b>If you are adding food additives:</b>
          <br />
          Food additives are substances added to foods to keep them fresh or to
          enhance their colour, flavour or texture. They may include food
          colourings, flavour enhancers (such as MSG) or a range of
          preservatives. Most food additives are listed on the product label,
          along with other ingredients, in descending order by weight (flavours
          are an exception and do not need to be identified).
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases you can define the food additive with either its name or
          the code number. Refer to schedule 7 and schedule 8 for food additive
          class names and code numbers.
          <br />
          For example, cochineal may be listed as colour (cochineal) or colour
          (120).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the food additive or flavouring contains allergens:
          <br />
          The allergen must be declared in the ingredient list using the
          required name. For example: caramel can be listed as caramel [150a{" "}
          <b>milk</b>]. Monosodium L-glutamate (MSG) can be listed MSG (
          <b>wheat</b>).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>If you are adding vitamins and minerals:</b>
          <br />
          Vitamins and minerals are a specific type of food additive. The
          vitamin or mineral may be declared using the class name of "vitamin"
          or "mineral".
          <br />
          Claims may be made about the presence of vitamins or minerals in food.
          However, there are complex labelling requirements for making these
          claims that are not covered by Label Buster.
          <br />
          It is recommended that you seek professional advice from a food
          labelling consultant to prepare your food label.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>If the food is, or contains sulphites:</b>
          <br />
          Sulphites must be declared in the ingredient list using the required
          name of "sulphites" when added sulphites are in concentrations of
          10mg/kg or more.

          A processing aid is a food or substance that is used during
          manufacture. For example, an antifoaming or clarifying agent. A
          processing aid is often an{" "}
