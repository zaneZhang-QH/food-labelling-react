          A date mark is a guide to how long a food will last. All packaged food with a shelf life of two years or less must
          show a date mark, except for individual portions of ice cream or ice confection.
        </p>
        <p>Shelf life refers to the length of time a food remains:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>safe to eat</li>
          <li>looks, smells and tastes ok, and</li>
          <li>retains any specific qualities for which claims have been made.</li>

          is required when a food becomes unsafe to eat. Food cannot be sold and should not be eaten after its{" "}

            best-before date
          </a>
          , but may not look, smell or taste the same as when it was fresh.
          Bread with a shelf life of less than 7 days can be date marked with a{" "}
          <a data-accordion-item="baked-for-on-date" className="accordion-btn">
            baked-on or baked-for date.
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>It may be necessary to seek expert advice from a food testing laboratory:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to determine your food’s shelf life</li>
          <li>to determine what type of date mark is required for your food.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Food Standards Code gives rules for the{" "}
          <a data-accordion-item="date-format" className="accordion-btn">
            format of the date mark
          </a>{" "}
          (how it appears on label). The day and month are required for a food
          with a shelf life of 3 months or less, whereas the month and year are
          required for a food with a longer shelf life.

          A best-before date is the last date on which you can expect a food to look, smell and taste fresh, and to keep any
          property for which a claim has been made. This is on the condition that the food has been stored according to any
          storage conditions on the label and the package is unopened.
        </p>
        <p>A food that has passed its best-before date will still be safe to eat.</p>
        <p>
          The words ‘Best Before’ must be included on the label followed by the date, or a direction provided about where the
          date is located. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Best Before 23 Dec 2021</li>
          <li>Best Before – see base of can</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Foods may be sold after the best-before date if the food has not spoiled and complies with any other legislation.</p>

        <p>The day, month and year must be written so that it is clear which number refers to the day, the month or the year.</p>
        <p>The month can be expressed in either:</p>

          <li>numerical form, e.g. 01 for January; or</li>

        <p>The year can be expressed in numerical form using either:</p>

          The date format depends on the shelf life of the food. The day and month (e.g. 15/03/2020) are required for a food

        <p>
          Lot identification means a number or other information that identifies the premises where the food was prepared or
          packed, and the batch the food is part of. This may be useful when several batches of the same food are prepared,
          manufactured or packed on the same day. There is no set format for lot identification.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not always necessary to include a lot identification on a label if a date mark, business name and address can
          identify the food. If date marking is not required, lot identification must be added so that the food can be
          identified.

          The use-by date is the date after which the food should not be eaten because it is no longer safe, provided it has
          been stored according to any stated storage conditions on the label and the package is unopened.
        </p>
        <p>For example, milk is usually labelled with a use-by date because it may become unsafe before it becomes rancid.</p>
        <p>
          You will need to determine the shelf life of your food to work out how long it can be safely stored. It is
          recommended you seek professional advice from a food testing laboratory.
        </p>
