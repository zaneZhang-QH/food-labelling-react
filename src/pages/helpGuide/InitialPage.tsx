        <p>
          Nutrition, health and related claims are voluntary statements made by
          food businesses on labels and in advertising about the content of
          certain nutrients or substances in a food, or the relationship between
          food and health.
        </p>
        <h4>Claims cannot be made about:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>kava</li>
          <li>infant formula</li>
          <li>
            any food that contains more than 1.15% alcohol by volume, other than
            a nutrition content claim about energy, carbohydrate or gluten
            content; or salt or sodium content about a food that is not a
            beverage.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Health claims</h4>
        <p>
          Health claims refer to a relationship between a food and health. For
          example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Calcium for bones and teeth</li>
          <li>
            Diets high in calcium may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in people
            65 years and over
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Health claims are not permitted on foods that are high in saturated
          fat, sugar or salt.
          <br />
          There are lists of pre-approved food-health relationships that
          businesses can base their claims on. These are listed in{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2015L00474"

          >
            Schedule 4 of the Code
          </a>
          .
        </p>

        <h4>Nutrition content claims</h4>
        <p>
          Nutrition content claims indicate the presence or absence of certain
          nutrients or substances in the food, for example, &apos;low in
          fat&apos; or &apos;good source of calcium&apos;. These claims will
          need to meet certain criteria set out in the Standard. For example,
          food with a &apos;good source of calcium&apos; claim will need to
          contain not less than the amount of calcium specified in the Standard.
        </p>

        <h4>Endorsements</h4>
        <p>
          An endorsement is a nutrition content claim or health claim that is
          made with the permission of an endorsing body, for example the Heart
          Foundation Tick.
        </p>

        <h4>Consumer value claims</h4>
        <p>
          Other consumer value claims such as cage free; organic or locally
          grown are covered by Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
