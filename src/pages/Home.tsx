          Label Buster is a step-by-step guide to help you identify the
          information you need to create a food label that meets Australian
          requirements. At the end of Label Buster, you will generate:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a product sheet you can give to a printer to design a label for you
          </li>
          <li>an example of what your food label should look like.</li>

        <h2>Who can use Label Buster?</h2>
        <p>
          Label Buster is designed for small to medium food businesses. If your
          food has complex labelling requirements, such as infant formula,
          sports supplements or alcohol, the tool does not provide all the
          information you need, and you are recommended to seek professional
          legal advice from a food labelling consultant.

                  <p>

          PLEASE NOTE: The Label Buster tool is in the process of being updated
          to incorporate the Plain English Allergen Labelling (PEAL) provisions
          of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code that came into effect
          on 25 February 2024.
