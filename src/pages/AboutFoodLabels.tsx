            Food labels must show the name of the food to help identify the
            food.

          <p>
            The name and description of the food must reflect its true nature.
            For example, strawberry yoghurt must contain strawberries. If the
            yoghurt contained strawberry flavouring rather than real fruit, then
            the name would need to indicate that it is strawberry-flavoured
            yoghurt.
