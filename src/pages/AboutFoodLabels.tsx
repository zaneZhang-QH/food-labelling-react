            The name and description of the food must reflect its true nature. For example, strawberry yoghurt must
            contain strawberries. If the yoghurt contained strawberry flavouring rather than real fruit, then the name
            would need to indicate that it is strawberry-flavoured yoghurt.

            For example, food labelled as being 500g should weigh 500g and use the metric system of grams (g), kilograms
